# ts-base
`ts-base` is an attempt at a simple AWS stack written in Typescript.

It consists of the following parts:
- API
- Application Base

## Contributing
All contributions would be welcome, However, since this is a learning project for me all commits must be tied to an issue with an adequate explanation to what it does/what's needed/why you did it that way.

All branches must follow an issue syntax: `issue-<number>-<issueTitle>`  
All commits must follow the commit syntax: `<emoji> [<issueNumber>] <message>`  
The following Emojis are:  
- ‚ú® New Feature
- üêõ Bug Fix
- üßπ Housekeeping (Tidy, Docs, ETC.)

## What this project should achieve 
The end goal of this repo is to have a project I can fork off for all existing projects.  
Technology I'd like to take advantage of is
- AWS Lambda
- AWS CloudWatch
- AWS Cloudformation
- GraphQL 

The reasoning behind the above choices is due to using these tools at work and wanting to standardise programming between work and home.
